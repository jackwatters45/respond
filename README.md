## Design

Google review replies matter, but given the capabilities of modern AI, there's no reason to spend hours crafting the perfect response. Responder is a tool that allows business owners to automate the process of replying to Google reviews. The tool uses a combination of AI and human input to generate responses that are both accurate and engaging.

Users can create custom templates for different types of reviews, and the tool will automatically generate responses based on the content of the review. The tool also allows users to customize the responses by adding their own personal touch. If you don't trust the AI, you can also manually edit the responses before sending them.
